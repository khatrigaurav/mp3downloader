# mp3downloader
This is an automatic music downloader developed using selenium. <br/><br/>
Helped me a lot to make custom roadtrip playlists whenever I was travelling to regions without network connectivity.

Step 1 : Make sure to download the latest version of selenium chromedriver as per your Google Chrome Version from this link : https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads  <br/>
Step 2 : Enter all the list of your songs to download line by line in the 'songfile.txt' text file. Following format works best : <name of song> <artist name>. <br/>
Step 3 : Run main bot.py.
